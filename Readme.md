## Nice to know

It is awesome when you write a better code even if it is a single line .

It's a moment that deserves to be proud of as a self-learning Developer.

**One of that moments in this project is this line of code that the instructor writes**

```javascript
const req = context.req;
```

While I use my knowledge in **Object Destructuring**

```javascript
const { req } = context;
```

Happy Coding üòç
